## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Clear Roles and Responsibilities: Scrum defines specific roles, such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, each with distinct responsibilities. This clarity in roles helps in reducing ambiguity and ensures that everyone understands their contribution to the project.

Enhanced Transparency: Scrum emphasizes transparency through artifacts like the product backlog, burndown charts, and Sprint Backlog. This transparency allows stakeholders to have a clear view of progress, impediments, and upcoming work.

Increased Collaboration: Scrum promotes collaboration among team members, stakeholders, and even across departments. The regular ceremonies, such as Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, and Sprint Review, facilitate communication and keep everyone on the same page.

Iterative Development: Scrum is based on short development cycles called Sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. This allows the team to deliver a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each Sprint. This iterative approach enables quick feedback and the ability to adapt to changing requirements.

Prioritized Backlog: Scrum utilizes a product backlog, a prioritized list of features or tasks that need to be completed. The Product Owner continuously refines and prioritizes the backlog based on business value, ensuring that the team focuses on the most important features first.

Flexibility to Change: Scrum embraces change and adapts to evolving requirements. If priorities shift or new information emerges, the team can easily adjust the backlog and plan for the next Sprint. This flexibility is crucial in dynamic IT environments.

Regular Inspections and Adaptations: Scrum includes regular ceremonies such as Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective, where the team reflects on what was done well, what could be improved, and adjusts their processes accordingly. This continuous improvement mindset helps in refining and optimizing the team's performance over time.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1- As a library member, I want to be able to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can easily find and borrow the books I am interested in.

2- As a library member, I want to see real-time availability status of a book, so that I can plan my visit to the library accordingly and know if the book is currently on the shelf or checked out.

3- As a library member, I want to be notified when the due date for my borrowed books is approaching, so that I can renew them if necessary or return them on time to avoid late fees.

4- As a library member, I want to have a personalized user profile where I can track my borrowing history, view my current checkouts, and manage my account details easily.

5- As a library member, I want to receive recommendations based on my reading history and preferences, so that I can discover new books that align with my interests.

6- As a user, I want to register as a library member, and ability to setup my preferences.

7- As a library staff member, I want a dashboard that provides real-time insights into book availability, popular genres, and borrowing trends, so that I can optimize the library's collection and services.

8- As a library member, I want to be able to place holds on books that are currently checked out, so that I can reserve a copy and be notified when it becomes available.

9- As a library administrator, I want to generate reports on the most borrowed books, popular genres, and user demographics, so that I can make data-driven decisions to improve the library's offerings.

10- As a mobile user, I want the website to be responsive and user-friendly on various devices, so that I can easily access and use the book-borrowing platform on my smartphone or tablet.```
